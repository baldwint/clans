   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Command-line Plans (``clans``)
==============================

Clans is a command-line client for the GrinnellPlans_ social network.

See what's going on in Portland:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clans read portland

Check quick love:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clans love

Edit your plan in ``$EDITOR``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clans edit

Not only is clans the most legit way to waste time on the internet,
but it is also a useful tool for:

  - automatically backing up your plan
  - scheduling a plan update for a later time
  - emailing yourself when new planlove arrives

and much much more. No Limitsâ„¢!
