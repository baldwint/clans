Clans
=====

Clans is a command-line client for the GrinnellPlans_ social network.

.. _GrinnellPlans: http://grinnellplans.com/

See what's going on in Portland::

    clans read portland

Check quick love::

    clans love

Edit your plan::

    clans edit  # opens in $EDITOR

Not only is Clans the most legit way to waste time on Plans, but it is
also a useful tool for:

  - automatically backing up your plan
  - scheduling a plan update for a later time
  - emailing yourself when new planlove arrives
  - much much more
