"""
Example extension for clans.

This extension implements every available hook as a no-op.

Each hook accepts one or more (usually mutable) arguments, and
returns nothing. Typically, arguments can be modified in-place or left
untouched.

The first argument passed is always the :class:`ClansSession` object.

# extension can save data in one hook and refer to it when a later
# hook is called.

    This hook is called right after the standard commands and
    arguments are defined.

    This hook is a good place to add arguments or subcommands to the
    command table, which you can do by modifying the ``commands``
    attribute of ``cs``.

    For example, to add an argument to an existing command::

        cs.commands['love'].add_argument(
                   '-t', '--time', dest='time',
                   action='store_true', default=False,
                   help="Order results by time first seen.")

    or, to add a whole new command::

        cs.commands.add_command(
                   'secrets', secrets, parents=[global_parser],
                   description='Glimpse into the souls of others.',
                   help='View secrets.')

    where ``secrets`` is a function you define elsewhere in your
    extension.
